            <h2>Neurodiversity</h2>
            <p>Differences like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are natural variations in human neurology, not deficits to be corrected or cured.</p>
            <p>Research consistently shows that neurodiversity is beneficial for human societies. For example, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review</a> describes neurodiversity as a 'competitive advantage', noting that autistic individuals often possess focused attention and exceptional pattern recognition. These traits can make them invaluable in roles requiring detailed analysis or complex problem-solving.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block">
            <h2>Double Empathy Problem</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Double Empathy Problem</a> explains that communication breakdowns occur in both directions between neurotypical and neurodivergent people. It is not that the neurodivergent individual fundamentally lacks social ability; rather, difficulties arise from a mismatch in communication styles. This disconnect often leads to the needs of those with ADHD or autism being misunderstood.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block">
            <h2>Personal commitment</h2>
            <p>My special interest in this area is deeply personal and informed by my life with my neurodivergent husband and adult son (AuDHD or ASD + ADHD). This first-hand experience ensures my therapeutic work is grounded in a full, realistic understanding of the complex challenges you face.</p>

      <div class="info-block fade-up delay-400" style="margin-top: 48px;">
        <h2>Why person-centred psychotherapy?</h2>
        <p>Person-Centred Psychotherapy (PCT) is a highly recommended approach for neurodivergent clients as it moves away from a medical diagnosis and focuses on your inner world and personal experience. <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2021.0065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research by Dr Romy Hume</a> highlights the importance of the PCT approach for working with autistic adults, noting that empathy, genuineness and caring are essential to build a strong therapeutic relationship.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2023.2278858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent studies</a> indicate it is vital that therapists possess foundational knowledge about neurodivergence. Clinicians who lack this understanding are frequently cited by autistic adults as a primary barrier to accessing helpful support.</p>
        <p>My work is person-centred, evidence-informed and authentic. I strive for clear communication and avoid "phony relationship techniques" to build the deep trust necessary for real work. My hope is to help you counter the shame and trauma often caused by years of feeling misunderstood and having to mask your authentic self.</p>

            My journey to psychotherapy has followed an unconventional path. With a PhD in Materials Science, I have spent many years in academic research, where I have developed a keen analytical mind and a rigorous approach to problem-solving.
